<h2>Childhood</h2>
<p> David Suzuki was the first of twins and was born here in Vancouver, BC on March 24, 1936. Very sadly, during World War 2 - because of a mixture of racism, descrimination, and fear - he and hsi family were sent to an intern cam in the BC with other Japanese Canadiansns. Before the he was sent to the camp, he was discriminated against for being Japanese - particularly after the Pearl Harbor Bombing. However, once he was sent to the camp, he was discriminated against from the other Japanese childeren for not being able to speak Japanese. As well as this, his father, who also his mentor and hero, was placed in a seperate labor camp.</p>

<p>A very important point of impact for David was the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing. His mother lost both of her parrents in the bombing, and he watched footage of survivers who suffured the aftermath of the bomb. Rumers were spreading at that time about how the bombs sterilized the land, and nothing again could ever grow in Hiroshima, or Nagasaki. This was a huge impact on him, seeing as this was when he realized the harmful effects of human technology with the enviroment - which he later will talk about in his extremely famous TV show, <i>'Force of Nature'</i>.</p>
